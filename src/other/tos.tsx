      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>Welcome to StudySync!</p>
      <p>
        By accessing or using our app, you agree to be bound by these terms of
        service. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not
        access the app.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Use License</h2>
      <p>
        a. Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the app for
        personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a
        license, not a transfer of title, and under this license, you may not:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>- modify or copy the materials;</li>
        <li>
          - use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public
          display (commercial or non-commercial);
        </li>
        <li>
          - attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in
          the app;
        </li>
        <li>
          - remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the
          materials; or
        </li>
        <li>
          - transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials
          on any other server.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        b. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of
        these restrictions and may be terminated by StudySync at any time. Upon
        terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of
        this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your
        possession whether in electronic or printed format.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The materials within the app are provided on an 'as is' basis. StudySync
        makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and
        negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied
        warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular
        purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation
        of rights.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        In no event shall StudySync or its suppliers be liable for any damages
        (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or
        due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use
        the app, even if StudySync or a StudySync authorized representative has
        been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
        Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
        warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental
        damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Revisions and Errata</h2>
      <p>
        The materials appearing in the app could include technical,
        typographical, or photographic errors. StudySync does not warrant that
        any of the materials are accurate, complete, or current. StudySync may
        make changes to the materials contained in the app at any time without
        notice. StudySync does not, however, make any commitment to update the
        materials.
      </p>
      <h2>5. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        Any claim relating to StudySync's app shall be governed by the laws of
        United States of America, and any additional terms or conditions without
        regard to its conflict of law provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the app, you agree to be bound by these terms of
        service. If you do not agree to any part of these terms, then you may
        not access the app.
